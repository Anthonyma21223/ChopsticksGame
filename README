#Chopsticks Game
Our goal is to make a chopsticks game.
The rules are to make the opponent 'bust'.
Each player  takes a turn to tap their opponent's hand (right or left). 
Tapping the opponent's hand will add your current hand score to their's.
If they reach 5 on any hand, that hand will bust.
Players can split the values among the other hand, but will cost a turn.
    Players who split may NOT have identical values in their hands (i.e. 3-2 cannot split to 2-3)
Revival of hands IS allowed via splitting (0-2 can split to 1-1). 
Players are NOT allowed to sacrifice a hand to increase the score of the other hand.
Players who have received a tap and their hand score is OVER 5 will have the remainder as their current score
